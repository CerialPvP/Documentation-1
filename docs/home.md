# Home Page

Hey there! Welcome to the official **DiSky v4 Wiki**!

You'll learn a lot of things about DiSky, with a setup-by-step guide, and a lot of examples! Simply select the page you want to see in the sidebar, or use the search bar to find what you're looking for!

These tutorials are made for **DiSky v4**, and therefore **v3 or older** may not work. No supports are given for these anyway!

!!! warning
    Keep in mind this website will **describe** everything it does, this means that __you better not just copy/paste the code without understanding it!__ If you don't understand something, please ask for help on the [Discord server](#useful-links).

## What is DiSky?

For those who don't know, DiSky is a Skript addon that allows you to interact with the Discord API, and create Discord bots with Skript!

!!! info
    For OG, DiSky is a full rework & updated version of Vixio, the previous "best" Discord addon for Skript.
